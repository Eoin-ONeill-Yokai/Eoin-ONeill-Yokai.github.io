Title: Joining the blog club...

This is one of those unnecessary "first-posts" that everyone chooses to have when they start a new blog. That aside, as you can plainly see, I've decided to start a blog -- but not for the usual reasons.

Firstly, I think a static website where I can randomly drop some thoughts of mine when I have them is a good idea since blogs are a nice medium for any long-form content. I generally don't find a lot of use in my twitter at the moment, but I think having a place to post some long posts might help motivate me to make more short blurbs on twitter which I can then direct to here for more details. Think of it as a glorified twitlonger -- but one I control and keep open source.

Secondly, a static webpage might present a way to keep notes that I need for various projects or tasks. This means that I will probably post occasional in-progress notes around smaller projects that I'm juggling. Some of these may relate to Krita (the open source software that I'm currently a full-time developer on) or other open source projects that I regularly contribute to or think about. Others might focus on art tasks or even just miscelaneous adventures!

Lastly, I really just want to stress test pelican some more. I'm an advocate for pelican's simplicity and I think that static sites help shift focus away from webdev by making solutions more "simple". With that being said, I haven't tried to manage a webpage that features frequently-updating content. Thus, I think its a good idea to give this a shot.

Oh, and I might shoot the shit here or post about video games with screenshots or videos. I'm sure I'll find things to talk about around hobbies as well, so it would be nice to share them with others!
